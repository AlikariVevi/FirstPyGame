This game is still under development.

If you want to try it:

    if you have Python3 and Pygame installed: 

      download the PyGame_Giannis(Not_so_much)Adventures.zip and click on the Giannis(Not_so_much)Adventures.bat file

    else if you have Python3 and not Pygame(and for some reason do not want to install it):

      go to https://vevi-alikari.itch.io/giannisnot-so-much and download Giannis(Not_so_much)Adventures.zip and run 
      Giannis(Not_so_much)Adventures.exe . You need to keep it in the same directory with the supporting files.

    else if you do not have Python3 installed and not have Python2:

      go to https://vevi-alikari.itch.io/giannisnot-so-much and download Giannis(Not_so_much)Adventures-0.5-amd64.msi 
      to install 
      the game and click on Giannis(Not_so_much)Adventures.exe. 
      Again you must keep it in the same directory as the rest of the files.

   else if you have Python2:

      upgrade

   Thanks
